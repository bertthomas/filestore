The XR25 test box is designed to analyse diagnostic information emitted by the computers fitted into the vehicle.
It enables the results to be clearly displayed for diagnosing the electronic system rapidly and precisly in-situ.

The test box offers the users three different ways of operating:
  - Diagnostic function: analyses and displays data
  - Multimeter functions: voltmeter
                          continuity tester
                          pulse detector and generator
  - Memory function: enables the context in which the incident occured to be stored and displayed.
  
The functions are selected on a 16-key keyboard.
  
The data are displayed by 2 types of display:
  - Bar graphs (left-hand side of the apparatus)
  - By a four-digit liquid crystal display (at the top of the apparatus).
    
This apparatus can be used both with the vehicle stationary and in a road test.
  
It is fed directly by the vehicle's battery :
  - Either by means of the same cable connected to the diagnostic socket.
  - Or by a cable connected directly  to the battery (supplied with the apparatus).
    
The functions necessary for interpreting the diagnostic data are contained in a memory cassette.

This cassette (9) is interchangable so as to allow the test programme to be updated in accordance with product developments and tests 
performed on new products available in the network. Each new cassette cancels and supersedes the preceding one. 

The ISO adapter (12) enables the operation of the test box to be rendered compatible with certain diagnostic transmissions features of the 
new computers such as : Bendix ABS, Air conditioning, Memorised seats, automatic transmission.

Fault finding

To use the test box for this function, it must be connected to the vehicle by means of cable U or V (see page 4).

Slide card (2) corresponding to the computer to be analysed in the magnetic mounting opposite the bar graphs (all the possible tests are 
indicated there.)

Position the selector on the ISO adaptor (12) as required (specified on the card and page 15).

Ensure the warning ligth /i\ on the iso adaptor is extinguished.

*Press key (D) followed by the two code numbers given on the diagnostic card corresponding to the product tested.*
Example: (D)(0)(3) for injection.
